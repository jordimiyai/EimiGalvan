# EimiGalvan

I specialize in the development of web applications and services. I discovered my passion for software development searching for simple solutions to everyday problems. I am a fast learner and enjoy it. The continuous learning process is what I love most about programming. I like working in teams to achieve collective goals and strongly believe that diversity and inclusion are key players in teamwork.
