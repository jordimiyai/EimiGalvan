# Hi, I'm Eimi 
Let me tell you little bit about me...
I specialize in the development of web applications and services. 
My passion for software development its something I realized because I was always searching for technical solutions to everyday problems. 
I like working in teams to achieve collective goals and strongly believe that diversity and inclusion are key players in teamwork.
The continuous learning process is what I love most about programming. 
I intend to keep getting better as a professional and hopefully work alongside others who enjoy coding as much as I do.
